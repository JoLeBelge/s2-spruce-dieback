	title = {Growth and development of the root system of {Norway} spruce ({Picea} abies) in forest {standsÐa} review},
	abstract = {The present article portrays root growth and root system development with special reference to Picea abies. Root phenology and ontogeny are depicted, and the biological responses of the roots to adverse growing conditions appraised. Norway spruce is regarded as a species which is able to grow under a wide range of soil physical and chemical conditions, provided suf®cient soil aeration is guaranteed. The root system of spruce is however sensitive to any dislocation of its primary taproot. Nursery handling and planting damage often affect the root system development of the young tree. Soil acidity and Al-toxicity represent other signi®cant restraints to root growth of spruce. Rooting patterns and mycorrhizal communities are in¯uenced by atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and acidity. Root system spread is closely related to the tree's competitive status in the forest stand and responds to forest management practices. The preference of Norway spruce roots for humus-rich soil horizons and patches is repeatedly reported. Though, a general characterisation of P. abies as a primary `surface-rooter' has been disproved. Different structures and functions of long and short roots can be identi®ed. Periodic shedding of small and ®brous root structures is a natural phenomenon and is in¯uenced by ambient (i.e. climatic) conditions. Nonetheless, adverse growing conditions result in an increased frequency of adventitious root formation. Permanent root system damage will occur when such root replacement strategies fail. The resulting occurrence of root derangement points and the loss of rami®cation orders, advances from the ®ne- to the coarse-root structures. The result is an irregular arrangement of the structural root system, with increasing frequency of damaged roots and disturbance of the root system symmetry. Damaged coarse roots are characterised by discolouration following decay. A damage class scheme for Norway spruce that depicts general stages of root system vitality and decay is provided. The work illustrates that root parameters are good indicators of the sustainability of forest sites.},

	abstract = {Intra-annual radial growth variations of two Norway spruce trees (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were monitored over 4 years, at four heights up the stem, by means of pointdendrometers. The trees were then felled and radial wood samples were cut from the radii that had been monitored by the dendrometers and analyzed for density. From the radial growth measurements recorded by the dendrometers, we related positions within the rings to dates, thus making possible investigation of the relationships between changes within the rings in wood density and fluctuations in climate or growth rate. Radial growth started in early April and ended, with large intra-annual differences, in August or September. Short-term variations in growth rate were related to fluctuations in climate parameters and soil water reserves. The sensitivity of radial growth to climate decreased with stem height. Wood density responded strongly to drought events, and a dry period in June 1996 induced false-ring formation. Wood density was relatively independent of growth rate and climatic conditions during the first part of the growing season, but increased with decreasing radial growth rate later in the growing season.},

	abstract = {Mixed stands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) frequently over-yield, when compared to respective monospeciﬁc stands. Over-yielding is attributed to enhanced resource uptake efﬁciency through niche complementarity alleviating species competition, for example through enhanced root stratiﬁcation in mixture. Under severe and frequent summer drought, however, water limitation may become crucial in modifying the prevailing competitive interaction in mixed beech-spruce forests. We hypothesize, therefore, that under drought (H I) inter-speciﬁc interaction with beech reduces water accessibility for spruce more than intra-speciﬁc conditions, thus (H II) exacerbating drought susceptibility of spruce in terms of reduced photosynthesis and stem growth. Reactions at the organ (leaf, ﬁne root), tree and stand scale were analysed in a mature forest with beech-spruce group mixture. Under inter-speciﬁc conditions spruce’s ﬁne-root production and depth of water uptake (assessed via d18O of xylem water) shifted to shallow, drought-prone soil horizons, in agreement with H I. Overall, lowered ﬁne root production and ramiﬁcation along with a reduction in long-distance explorative ectomycorrhizal types resulted in decreased soil exploitation in spruce when growing together with beech. Spruce’s drought sensitivity was exempliﬁed by a distinct decrease in stomatal conductance, net CO2 uptake rate and stem growth during periods of water limitation. Notwithstanding, species interaction effects were absent in leaf gas exchange and stem diameter growth, during a six-week summer drought period in 2013 as well as in the extremely dry year of 2003, hence rejecting H II. Based on results from soil moisture measurements and water uptake depth, we interpret the conﬂicting ﬁndings for H I and H II to result from: (i) seasonal shifts between positive (during spring drought) and negative (during summer drought) effects of beech neighbourhood on soil water availability for spruce, possibly overriding each other in their effect on annual stem diameter growth and (ii) the group-wise mixture pattern, where spruce is exposed to competition with beech only along group edges, i.e. laterally only, so that the putatively adverse beech effect on water accessibility stays limited. Our results suggest, compared to single tree mixture, group-wise mixture of beech and spruce to be a favourable silvicultural option in the face of climate change.},

The total ring chronology variance attributable to climate averages 34.1\% (15.8\% –57\%).

The experimental site consisted of two plots in a mature spruce monoculture stand.

Root samples were collected during autumn in 2010, 2012, and 2013. Root analyses revealed the effect of drought stress on mycorrhizal root tips changed over time. While a density of active mycorrhizae was about 34\% lower in drought-stressed areas compared to nonstressed (control) areas in 2010, it increased by 15\% in 2012 and by 22\% in 2013 over both plots. We observed the less pronounced effect of drought on a proportion of active mycorrhizae, but it generally followed the pattern of active mycorrhizae density. The density of nonactive mycorrhizae was not influenced by drought but significantly fluctuated during the course of the experiment. Other root characteristics such as the dry mass of fine roots ({\textbackslash}textless 1 mm), the specific length of fine roots ({\textbackslash}textless 1 mm) and the composition of the ectomycorrhizal community (primarily dominated by Amphinema byssoides, Tylospora fibrillosa, Tylopilus felleus, and Cenococcum geophilum) were also not significantly influenced by drought.

However, if other seasonal cues such as photoperiod dictate when photosynthetic capacity declines, warmer autumn temperatures may have little effect on when carbon uptake capacity decreases in these species. We investigated whether autumn warming would delay photosynthetic decline in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) by growing seedlings under declining weekly photoperiods and weekly temperatures either at ambient temperature or a warming treatment 4 °C above ambient. Photosynthetic capacity was relatively constant in both treatments when weekly temperatures were {\textbackslash}textgreater8 °C, but declined rapidly at lower temperatures, leading to a delay in the autumn decline in photosynthetic capacity in the warming treatment. The decline in photosynthetic capacity was not related to changes in leaf nitrogen or chlorophyll concentrations, but was correlated with a decrease in the apparent fraction of leaf nitrogen invested in Rubisco, implicating a shift in nitrogen allocation away from the Calvin cycle at low autumn growing temperatures. Our data suggest that as the climate warms, the period of net carbon uptake will be extended in the autumn for boreal forests dominated by Norway spruce, which could increase total carbon uptake in these forests.},

Mixed stands have often shown to be more productive than monospecific stands in terms of yield and of resistance against windthrows and bark beetle attacks. Mixture of beech and spruce is of particular interest. However, little is known about its growth reaction to drought. Therefore, we investigated the drought reaction of beech and spruce in mixed vs. monospecific stands along an ecological gradient. In particular, we sought evidence for mixture-related resilience on the individual tree level. Therefore, we quantified the response of tree ring width to drought. Moreover, we attempted to explain the relevance of individual tree response on the stand level by quantifying the stand level loss of volume growth after drought. At the individual tree level, beech was found to be more resilient and resistant in pure vs. mixed stands. Spruce, in contrast, was favored by mixture, and this was especially evident on drier sites. Along the gradient, growth losses at stand level increased in both mixed and pure stands in 2015, with growth gains on the drier sites observed in the same drought year, in accordance with the Stress Gradient Hypothesis. However, the stand level difference of growth loss between mixed and pure stands was not statistically significant. Mitigating mixture effects on the level of the individual tree thus did not become evident on the level of the whole stand.},

Two common species, Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) and white fir (Abies alba Mill.) were compared. The regional study was carried out on 33 populations located in four alpine valleys along a climatic gradient of summer aridity (Tarentaise, Maurienne, and Brianconnais, in France, and Susa valley in Italy). For most of species and regions, several negative ring-width pointer years with abrupt growth reductions such as 1976, 1922, 1986, and 1944 were common (listed in order of decreasing importance). However, spruce growth was more reduced in 1948 than that of fir. At the country scale, some of the strongest positive (e.g., 1932, 1964, 1969) and negative (e.g., 1956, 1962, 1976, 1986) pointer years extended over the whole of France, whereas the geographic variability was explainable by the autoecology of species. At both studied scales, evident climatic interpretations such as severe winter frosts, 'unusual summer droughts, or excessive wet and cold springs can explain most of the negative pointer years. Conversely, most positive growth responses are caused by a local combination of favorable climatic factors rather than simple extreme events, and therefore are less efficient for wood dating.},

For those years, growth variations were higher for Abies alba than for Picea abies. For each species, the climate information of tree ring series is not modiﬁed by local site characteristics (altitude, slope, aspect, soil water reserve). Moreover, strong speciﬁc diﬀerences appear among species. Earlywood and latewood spruce growth mainly depends on current summer soil water deﬁcit conditions. For silver ﬁr, winter and early summer temperatures, as well as the water supply of the previous year (August to October) play a major role for the production of earlywood, after which the current early summer water supply inﬂuences mainly latewood width.},

Results show a general north-eastern and altitudinal shift in climatological favourability for both species, although the shift is more marked for spruce. The gain of new favourable sites in the north or in the Alps is stronger for beech compared to spruce. Uncertainty is expressed as the variance of the averaged maps and with a density function. Uncertainty in species distribution increases over time.

	abstract = {The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is one of the major insect pests of mature Norway spruce forests. In this study, a model describing the temperature-dependent thresholds for swarming activity and temperature requirement for development from egg to adult was driven by transient regional climate scenario data for Sweden, covering the period of 1961–2100 for three future climate change scenarios (SRES A2, A1B and B2). During the 20th century, the weather supported the production of one bark beetle generation per year, except in the north-western mountainous parts of Sweden where the climate conditions were too harsh. A warmer climate may sustain a viable population also in the mountainous part; however, the distributional range of I. typographus may be restricted by the migration speed of Norway spruce. Modelling suggests that an earlier timing of spring swarming and fulﬁlled development of the ﬁrst generation will signiﬁcantly increase the frequency of summer swarming. Model calculations suggest that the spruce bark beetle will be able to initiate a second generation in South Sweden during 50\% of the years around the mid century. By the end of the century, when temperatures during the bark beetle activity period are projected to have increased by 2.4–3.8 1C, a second generation will be initiated in South Sweden in 63–81\% of the years. The corresponding ﬁgures are 16–33\% for Mid Sweden, and 1–6\% for North Sweden. During the next decades, one to two generations per year are predicted in response to temperature, and the northern distribution limit for the second generation will vary. Our study addresses questions applicable to sustainable forest management, suggesting that adequate countermeasures require monitoring of regional differences in timing of swarming and development of I. typographus, and planning of control operations during summer periods with large populations of bark beetles.},

A moving window algorithm was developed to distinguish between forest ingrowth and upward shift. To test a possible climate change inﬂuence, the resulting upward shifts were compared to a potential regional tree line. Results: A signiﬁcant increase of forest cover was found between 1650 m and 2450 m. Above 1650 m, 10\% of the new forest areas were identiﬁed as true upward shifts whereas 90\% represented ingrowth, and we identiﬁed both land use and climate change as likely drivers. Most upward shift activities were found to occur within a band of 300 m below the potential regional tree line, indicating land use as the most likely driver. Only 4\% of the upward shifts were identiﬁed to rise above the potential regional tree line, thus indicating climate change. Conclusions: Land abandonment was the most dominant driver for the establishment of new forest areas, even at the tree line ecotone. However, a small fraction of upwards shift can be attributed to the recent climate warming, a fraction that is likely to increase further if climate continues to warm, and with a longer time-span between warming and measurement of forest cover.},

	abstract = {The severity and spatial extent of bark-b­ eetle outbreaks substantially increased in recent decades worldwide. The ongoing controversy about natural forest recovery after these outbreaks highlights the need for individual-b­ased long-t­erm studies, which disentangle processes driving forest regeneration. However, such studies have been lacking. To fill this gap, we followed the fates of 2,552 individual seedlings for 12 years after a large-s­cale bark-­beetle outbreak that caused complete canopy dieback in mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in southeast Germany. We explore the contribution of advance, disturbance-r­elated, and post-­disturbance regeneration to forest recovery. Most seedlings originated directly within the three-y­ ear dieback of canopy trees induced by bark-­beetle outbreak. After complete canopy dieback, the establishment of new seedlings was minimal. Surprisingly, advance regeneration formed only a minor part of all regeneration. However, because it had the highest survival rate, its importance increased over time. The most important factor influencing the survival of seedlings after disturbance was their height. Survival was further modified by microsite: seedlings established on dead wood survived best, whereas almost all seedlings surrounded by graminoids died. For 5 cm tall seedlings, annual mortality ranged from 20 to 50\% according to the rooting microsite. However, for seedlings taller than 50 cm, annual mortality was below 5\% at all microsites. While microsite modified seedling mortality, it did not affect seedling height growth. A model of regeneration dynamics based on short-t­erm observations accurately predicts regeneration height growth, but substantially underestimates mortality rate, thus predicting more surviving seedlings than were observed. We found that P. abies forests were able to regenerate naturally even after severe bark-b­ eetle outbreaks owing to advance and particularly disturbance-r­ elated regeneration. This, together with microsite-s­ pecific mortality, yields structurally and spatially diverse forests. Our study thus highlights the so far unrecognized importance of disturbance-r­ elated regeneration for stand recovery after bark-b­ eetle outbreaks.

We used an extended data-set of fossil pollen records over Europe to reconstruct spatial variation in Tjan values for each 1000-year time slice between 10,000 and 3000 years BP (before present). We evaluated the relationships between the occurrences of the three species at each time slice and the spatially interpolated Tjan values, and compared these to their modern temperature ranges. Our results reveal that F. sylvatica and P. abies experienced Tjan ranges during the Holocene that differ from those of the present, while A. alba occurred over a Tjan range that is comparable to its modern one. Our data suggest the need for re-evaluation of the assumption of stable climate tolerances at a scale of several thousand years. The temperature range instability in our observed data independently validates similar results based exclusively on modeled Holocene temperatures. Our study complements previous studies that used modeled data by identifying variation in frequencies of occurrence of populations within the limits of suitable climate. However, substantial changes that were observed in the realized thermal niches over the Holocene tend to suggest that predicting future species distributions should not solely be based on modern realized niches, and needs to account for the past variation in the climate variables that drive species ranges.},

	abstract = {In Europe, mixed mountain forests, primarily comprised of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), cover about 10 × 10 6 ha at elevations between ∼600 and 1600 m a.s.l. These forests provide invaluable ecosystem services. However, the growth of these forests and the competition among their main species are expected to be strongly affected by climate warming. In this study, we analyzed the growth development of spruce, fir, and beech in moist mixed mountain forests in Europe over the last 300 years. Based on tree-ring analyses on long-term observational plots, we found for all three species (i) a nondecelerating, linear diameter growth trend spanning more than 300 years; (ii) increased growth levels and trends, the latter being particularly pronounced for fir and beech; and (iii) an elevation-dependent change of fir and beech growth. Whereas in the past, the growth was highest at lower elevations, today’s growth is superior at higher elevations. This spatiotemporal pattern indicates significant changes in the growth and interspecific competition at the expense of spruce in mixed mountain forests. We discuss possible causes, consequences, and silvicultural implications of these distinct growth changes in mixed mountain forests.},

There was an increase of 0.5 and 0.1 Mg ha−1 per 100 mm year−1 precipitation for the two size classes of fine roots. If the adaption of root production can match the pace of global warming and water is not a limiting factor for plant growth, fine root biomass would be expected to increase by 40–140\% in response to the predicted increase in temperature (3–10°C) over the next century. Our analyses highlighted the strongly positive influences of temperature and precipitation on belowground function, suggesting that predicted future climate change could substantially enhance belowground biomass in the boreal region where the greatest warming is anticipated.

Analyzing high-resolution annual satellite-based canopy mortality maps from 1987 to 2016 we here show that excess forest mortality (i.e., canopy mortality exceeding the long-term mortality trend) is significantly related to drought across continental Europe. The relationship between water availability and mortality showed threshold behavior, with excess mortality increasing steeply when the integrated climatic water balance from March to July fell below −1.6 standard deviations of its long-term average. For −3.0 standard deviations the probability of excess canopy mortality was 91.6\% (83.8–97.5\%). Overall, drought caused approximately 500,000 ha of excess forest mortality between 1987 and 2016 in Europe. We here provide evidence that drought is an important driver of tree mortality at the continental scale, and suggest that a future increase in drought could trigger widespread tree mortality in Europe.},

The results show that the range limit has begun to track climate change more closely than in the past, and a future projection predicts a rapid northward contraction of the present limit. Contracting ranges track climate change more closely than do expanding ranges that are limited by seed dispersal. The physiological mechanism of the climatic control is unclear, but Picea planted beyond its current climatic range limit was seriously damaged during a recent storm. Planting trees beyond their natural climatic range limits can only be advised in areas that become suitable for colonization under a changed climate.},

Intraannual dynamics of wood formation, shoot elongation and needle phenology were monitored over 3 years in five Norway spruces (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), five Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) and five silver firs (Abies alba Mill.) grown intermixed. For the three species, the growing season (delimited by cambial activity onset and cessation) lasted about 4 months, while the whole process of wood formation lasted 5–6 months. Needle unfolding and shoot elongation followed the onset of cambial activity and lasted only one-third of the season. Pines exhibited an ‘extensive strategy’ of cambial activity, with long durations but low growth rates, while firs and spruces adopted an ‘intensive strategy’ with shorter durations but higher growth rates. We estimated that about 75\% of the annual radial increment variability was attributable to the rate of cell production, and only 25\% to its duration. Cambial activity rates culminated at the same time for the three species, whereas shoot elongation reached its maximal rate earlier in pines. Results show that species-specific life strategies are recognizable through functional traits of intra-annual growth dynamics. The opposition between Scots pine extensive strategy and silver fir and Norway spruce intensive strategy supports the theory that pioneer species are greater resource expenders and develop riskier life strategies to capture resources, while shade-tolerant species utilize resources more efficiently and develop safer life strategies. Despite different strategies, synchronicity of the maximal rates of cambial activity suggests a strong functional convergence between co-existing conifer species, resulting in head-on competition for resources.},

Based on a literature review, we assessed the impact of three different harvest methods—clearcut, patchcut, and selective harvest—on nitrate concentrations in temperate forest streams. In a meta-analysis, the inﬂuence of harvest methods and additional environmental variables was analysed. Nitrate concentrations are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by harvest methods, forest composition, site altitude, and time passed after the harvesting. The remaining unexplained between-site variability is small compared to the between-site variability explained by the model, indicating the model’s validity. The effect of forest harvest is most pronounced in coniferous and deciduous forests, where clearcuts and patchcuts result in high nitrate run-off three to ﬁve years after harvest. Mixed forest plots can compensate for clearcut and patchcut, and do not show a signiﬁcantly increased nitrate concentration after harvest. Selective harvest at low intensities succeeded in maintaining nitrate levels similar to control or pre-harvest levels in coniferous and mixed forests, and showed a positive but not signiﬁcant trend in deciduous forests. Coniferous and deciduous monocultures clearly face the problem that nitrate wash-out cannot be minimized by reducing clearcut to patchcut harvest, whereas mixed forests are more suitable to diminish nitrate wash-out in both clearcut and patchcut.},

Consecutive dry years are made responsible for this phenomenon. Leaf trait measurements, in specific leaf osmotic potential (πosm) and leaf water potential at turgor loss (πtlp), indicate that the underlying mechanisms for tree mortality are most likely different between the two species. πtlp of spruce was highly negative, revealing a potentially high drought tolerance of the species. πtlp of Scots pine was less negative, suggesting a higher susceptibility to drought stress. I conclude that the mortality of Norway spruce might be caused by rising temperatures and that the summer temperatures in the past years were beyond the species thermal tolerance threshold. Overall, I want to highlight and enhance the discussion that the search for suitable species for a climate change adapted forest should go in both directions, i.e., species should be chosen to make the forest fit for both increasing drought and heat stress.},

	abstract = {To investigate whether drought tolerance of individual trees can be increased through the provision of more growing space, trees from a thinning experiment were analysed for reductions in radial growth during drought years and their subsequent recovery. Tree-ring widths were quantiﬁed on increment cores as well as stem discs of 32 trees from stands of a thinning trial established in 1974 in 27-year-old spruce stands in the Alpine Foreland of Southwest Germany. Three different thinning regimes of the trial were selected for this study: unthinned control (8 trees), moderate (13 trees) and heavy thinning (11 trees) intensities. All trees sampled were of a co-dominant to dominant canopy status. The standardisation of growth data was carried out using the software program ARSTAN (University of Arizona). For the year 1976—a widespread and severe drought year in Germany—we found year ring widths were not reduced compared to those of the pre-drought years for all treatments. However, we observed the formation of false year rings and resin ducts for this year in all trees investigated. The drought events in 1992 and 2003 led to severe growth depressions in the year of the drought event in all trees, regardless of previous thinning regimes. However, the resilience—the recovery of basal area growth in subsequent years—was signiﬁcantly more rapid in trees from heavily thinned stands, even if the drought event occurred more than 10 years after the last thinning intervention. This indicates a shorter stress period for trees with more growing space, which may reduce the susceptibility to secondary pathogens or pest species such as bark beetles.},

	abstract = {In response to a wide-spread decline in forest vitality associated with acid rain in the 1980s, liming of soils has been implemented in many federal states in Germany to buffer further acid deposition and improve availability of nutrients such as calcium and magnesium. As a consequence, it may also increase vitality and depth of ﬁneroot systems and hence improve the drought tolerance of species such as Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.], which occurs mostly on acidic forest soils. However, the inﬂuence of repeated liming on drought tolerance of trees has never been studied. Here we compared the resistance, recovery and resilience of radial growth in P. abies in relation to drought in limed and control stands and assessed how the dosage and interval between lime application and drought year inﬂuences the radial growth response of P. abies. We analyzed radial growth in 198 P. abies trees of six experimental sites in south–west Germany. An analysis of the radial increment over the last 30 years allowed the analysis of drought events shortly after the ﬁrst liming (short-term effect) as well as posterior drought events (mid- to long-term effects). Generalized linear models were developed to assess the inﬂuence of drought intensity, site and period since ﬁrst liming on the drought tolerance of Norway spruce. Regardless of drought intensity, there was no general increase in drought resistance of Norway spruce in response to liming. However, drought resistance of radial growth improved on a loamy site that was additionally treated with wood ash 30 years after the ﬁrst lime application. Furthermore, recovery and resilience of radial growth after severe drought events were generally better in spruce trees of limed treatments. This indicates a shorter stress period in spruce trees growing on limed soil, which may reduce their susceptibility to secondary, drought-related pests and pathogens.},

Beyond potential negative effects of climate change such as decreasing productivity due to an increasing number of drought periods and damages from intensiﬁed disturbance regimes, there is also a potential for increasing productivity due to prolonged vegetation periods and higher photosynthetic rates. Quantitative genetic variation is crucial for adaptability of species towards environmental changes. The use of suitable reproductive material for forest regeneration will be a key factor essential for both, mitigating negative effects and making the most of potential positive effects. Therefore, insights into intraspeciﬁc variation within and among tree populations in climate response are of paramount importance.},

In these temperature and Norway spruce bud burst time series we detected years with the highest probability for discontinuities.

	abstract = {Although drought aﬀects directly tree physiology and growth, the impact of secondary factors (insect pests, pathogens and ﬁre) is often greater than the impact of the original stress and can lead to important tree mortality. In 2003, Western and Central Europe experienced a drought and heat waves that led to extensive forest damage. This paper reports on the impacts of drought and high temperatures on forest insect populations in the context of this exceptional event. Observations of changes in population levels of the main European forest insect pests during and after the drought are presented and discussed in the light of current knowledge and theories of interactions between drought and insects. We investigated the direct eﬀects of drought on life history traits and indirect eﬀects through physiological changes experienced by host trees. Forest pest insects were separated in 4 feeding guilds: woodborers, leaf-chewers, leaf-miners and leaf-suckers. The impact of water stress varied according to feeding guilds. Woodborers were positively inﬂuenced by prolonged water stress and the decline of host resistance. In contrast, defoliators proﬁted better from the increased nitrogen in plant tissues linked to moderate or intermittent water stress. Field observations showed the importance of the soil water status in tree resistance against pest attacks. Thus, the 2003 drought conﬁrmed observations from earlier droughts that, is case of bad choice of tree species in some plantations, site matching becomes a prominent and primary cause of the development of pest outbreaks. This exceptional drought may give us some indication of the impacts of extreme climatic events. However, observations of the performance at the individual level were not suﬃcient for predicting long-term insect population dynamics, which depends on complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible weather effect on the biology of and damage caused by Ips typographus L. in the southeastern Alps. The study was carried out recording temperature (1962Ð2007), precipitation (1922Ð2007), and the damage caused by I. typographus (1993Ð2007). In addition, data from pheromone-baited traps (1996 Ð2005) provided information on the main periods of ßight activity of I. typographus. From 1922 to 2007, precipitation during MarchÐJuly has decreased Ϸ200 mm (Ϫ22\%), whereas since 1962Ð2007, mean temperatures during MarchÐJuly increased Ϸ2ЊC (ϩ13\%). Damage caused by I. typographus was inversely correlated with MarchÐJuly precipitation from the previous year but not correlated with temperature. Increases in spring temperature did not affect the development timing of the Þrst generation, but only changed its onset. Earlier swarming of both overwintering beetles and Þrst-generation offspring (Ϸ20 d sooner over 10 yr), and the early start of the second generation permitted more complete development of the second brood. Voltinism in this species is discussed in relation to thermal and photoperiodic thresholds, indicating that the occurrence of a third generation is limited by the summer photoperiod rather than by temperature. In conclusion, results suggest that spring drought increases damage caused by I. typographus in the following year, whereas warmer spring affects insect phenology.},

	abstract = {The Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), for the EU. I. typographus is a well-deﬁned and distinguishable species, recognised mainly as a pest of spruce (Picea spp.) in Eurasia. It also attacks other conifers such as Abies spp., Larix spp., Pinus spp. and Pseudotsuga menziesii. Native to Eurasia, I. typographus has spread from the native range of spruce to new areas in Eurasia where spruce has been planted, and is now widely distributed throughout the EU (22 Member states). It is a quarantine pest listed in Annex IIB of Council Directive 2000/29/EC for Ireland and United Kingdom as protected zones. Coniferous wood, bark and wood packaging material are considered as pathways for the pest, which is also able to disperse by ﬂight over tens of kilometres. The insects normally establish on fallen trees but can also mass-attack healthy trees, killing millions of spruces. The males produce pheromones that attract conspeciﬁcs of both sexes. Each male attracts one to four females; each female produces 2–80 offspring. The insects also inoculate pathogenic fungi to their hosts. There are one to three generations per year. The wide current geographic range of I. typographus suggests that it is able to establish anywhere in the EU where its hosts are present. Sanitary thinning or clear-felling are the major control methods. Pheromone mass trapping is presently judged unreliable because of the large dispersal capacity of the pest. Quarantine measures are implemented to prevent entry in yet uncolonised areas. All criteria assessed by EFSA for consideration as potential protected zone quarantine pest are met. The criteria for considering I. typographus as a potential regulated nonquarantine pest are not met since plants for planting are not a pathway.},

	abstract = {The eight-toothed spruce bark beetle ( Ips typographus ) is the most serious insect pest in Central European forests. During the past two decades, extreme meteorological events and subsequent beetle infestations have killed millions of cubic meters of standing spruce trees. Not all the infested stands could be cleared in time, and priorities in management had to be set. Natural or man-made buffer zones of about 500 meters in width are frequently defined to separate differently managed stands in Central Europe. While the buffer zones seem to be effective in most of the cases, their impact has not been studied in detail. Beetle densities were therefore assessed in three case studies using pheromone traps along transects, leading from infested stands into spruce-free buffer zones. The results of the trap catches allow an estimation of the buffer zone influence on densities and the dispersal of Ips typographus . Beetle densities were found to decrease rapidly with increasing distance from the infested spruce stands. The trap catches were below high-risk thresholds within a few hundred meters of the infested stands. The decrease in catches was more pronounced in open land and in an urban area than in a broadleaf stand. Designed buffer zones of 500 m width without spruce can therefore very probably help to reduce densities of spreading beetles.},

	abstract = {In Central Europe and North America, bark beetle infestations cause considerable economic losses. If infested trees are not rapidly removed, large areas can be damaged. Removal of infested trees has to be done during the so-called “green-attack” stage, which is before the bark beetles move to other trees. Field surveys even if they are feasible are cost intensive and impractical if large areas have to be monitored. The aim of the study was to analyse the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite imagery for detecting bark beetle infestations of two intensity stages (e.g. “dead” and “green-attack”) against “healthy” (nonattacked) trees. For classifying individual trees two classifiers, random forest and logistic regression, were evaluated. Despite the relative large class overlap in the spectral signatures, the sample trees (n = 600) could be assigned to the classes “dead”, “green-attack”, and “healthy” with an overall accuracy of about 75\%. Producer’s and user’s accuracies of all classes were around 70\%. The best result was obtained with random forests using the eight spectral bands of a WorldView-2 image acquired in July. With this dataset, an overall accuracy of 76\% and a kappa coefficient of 0.61 were achieved. For the separation of the classes “healthy” and “greenattack”, vegetation indices based on 2-band normalized differences as well as ratios yielded nearly as good results as the classification with all eight spectral bands. The best results were obtained by combining either the Green or Yellow band with the Near Infrared 1. With regard to individual bands, the Yellow and the Red band are defined as most important ones. We can conclude that 8-band WorldView-2 imagery has the potential for creating hotspot maps of infested trees or of trees with an increased risk of infestation. This could have positive implications for the forest practice.},

Drought decreased mycorrhizal colonization signiﬁcantly. There was a signiﬁcant interaction of drought and N effects on reduction of the mycorrhizal colonization. Although all of the mycorrhiza types were inﬂuenced by drought, only Cenococcum geophilum showed a signiﬁcant change.

Irrespective of the treatments applied, time to bud burst decreased with increased duration of previous exposure to natural chilling and freezing events. Fluctuating day/night temperatures and continuous lengthening of the photoperiod hastened bud burst. Shortening the photoperiod delayed bud burst, suggesting that little or no ontogenetic development toward bud burst takes place during mild periods before the winter solstice. In the case of climatic warming, this phenomenon may prevent the premature onset of growth that has been predicted by computer simulations with models that only consider temperature regulation of bud burst.},

The daily average temperature, the driving factor for bud burst in the model, was adjusted using the difference between the mean of the climate model data for the years 1961Á1990 and 2036Á2065. The model was run for a highly frost prone, clear-cut site in which bare-rooted Norway spruce seedlings of mid-Swedish provenance were planted. Alternate runs were conducted with data for containerized seedlings and seedlings of Belarusian origin. The study showed that bud burst will occur at earlier dates throughout Sweden in the period 2036Á2065 if the climate changes according to either of the climate scenarios examined, compared to the reference period 1961Á1990. Furthermore, the risk of damage to Norway spruce seedlings as a result of frost events during summer will increase in southern Sweden and be unaffected or decrease in northern Sweden. The risk of frost damage was exacerbated in containerized seedlings, while the risk was lower for the seedlings of Belarusian provenance when compared with bare-rooted seedlings or seedlings of mid-Swedish origin.},

Thus, assessments of critical constraints of water supply in forest trees are needed to develop adequate for­ est adaptation measures. We present a novel ‘critical limit’ approach to soil water availability (SWA) for the major central European forest tree species based on the physio­ logical plant water status. In regards to the conductivity of trees’ xylem, three thresholds of pre-dawn water potential (ψwp) were chosen, referring to (i) slight conductivity loss (10 \%), (ii) critical conductivity loss (50 \%) and (iii) com­ plete conductivity loss ({\textbackslash}textgreater 90 \%). In times of drought, predawn water potential relates to the soil water potential at the lowest soil depth in which plant’s root system is able to deplete water resources; the ‘effective rooting depth’ (ERD). The critical limit of soil water availability (CL-SWA) represents the proportion of plant-available water within the variable effective rooting depth (ERD) that meets both the critical soil water potential at the lower limit of the ERD and the critical plant water status. The CL-SWA-ap­ proach can be implemented in water budget models like BROOK90.},

Forestry planning and climate change scenarios are based on similar (long-term) timescales, i.e. between 70 and 120 yr. Within the EU project ‘Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes’ (MICE), we have used ‘present day’ runs (1961–1990) and future scenarios (2070–2100, emission scenarios A2 and B2 from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios [SRES]) of the HadRM3 regional climate model to study and model direct and indirect effects of changing climate on Norway spruce in Sweden and northern Europe. According to our results, extreme climate events like spring temperature backlashes and summer drought will increase in frequency and duration. In combination with a raised mean temperature, climate extremes will negatively precondition trees (i.e. increase their susceptibility) to secondary damage through pests and pathogens. Decreased forest vitality also makes stands more susceptible to windthrow. Storm damage is discussed based on a 100 yr storm damage record for Sweden. Marginally increased frequencies and windspeeds of storms may cause disproportionate increases in windthrow. Increased economic hazards can be expected from a combination of the increased volumes of wind-thrown timber, and a greater likelihood of additional generations of spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (further encouraged by the increase in fallen timber), as a result of a changing climate with warmer summers.},

	abstract = {Forests store signiﬁcant quantities of carbon, and accurate quantiﬁcation of the fate of this carbon after ﬁre is necessary for global carbon accounting. Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) encompasses various carbonaceous products of incomplete combustion formed during ﬁres and has potential to act as a carbon sink for up to millennia, but current estimates of PyC production in wildﬁres vary widely. Northern hardwood forests have changed dramatically in recent decades due to insect epidemics, such as the bark beetle epidemic in the Rocky Mountain Region which has caused widespread mortality. This study assessed impacts of bark beetle-induced mortality on fuel pyrolysis kinetics, carbon partitioning of combustion products, and net heat output to aid in forest ﬁre modeling and carbon accounting by comparing healthy and beetle-killed lodgepole pine tree boles burned in a 2018 forest ﬁre in southeast Wyoming, USA with unburned boles. Results showed charring predominantly restricted to the bark and cambium. Signiﬁcant differences between burned and unburned healthy and beetle-impacted bark/cambium compositions were identiﬁed, and PyC production and energy output were quantiﬁed. Charring extent and PyC content were found to be greater in beetle-impacted boles due to a reduction in bark/cambium resistance to heating and charring, with 80 times more PyC produced in a beetle-killed bark/cambium than in a healthy bark/cambium. Upon scale-up, total PyC production in the ﬁre-affected area was estimated to be 0.71 GgPyC (82.5 kgPyC/ha). This was found to be signiﬁcantly enhanced compared to an estimated PyC production of 0.036 GgPyC (4.12 kgPyC/ha) in a hypothetical healthy lodgepole pine ecosystem of equal area. The results of this investigation concluded that the 58\% beetle-induced mortality in the Badger Creek Fire area resulted in 3 times more carbon released to the global atmosphere, 20 times more PyC retained onsite and 32\% greater heat output during wildﬁre.},

In the southeastern United States (U.S.), Dendroctonus frontalis is one of the most important forest pests that can cause substantial tree mortality over large geographic areas. As life-history of D. frontalis is dependent on environmental conditions, our objective was to determine the effects of climatic variables on the species occurrence of D. frontalis and their main predator, Thanasimus dubius. U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service beetle trapping data (proxy for true abundance) for 2014–2018 were assessed with nine climatic variables including: (1) average monthly minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures; (2) mean winter temperature; (3) minimum, maximum and mean annual temperature; and (4) cumulative winter and annual precipitation. Variable selection was performed using least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO), and selected variables were fit to varying coefficient generalized additive models (GAMs). Minimum temperatures for February and March and maximum temperatures for January and prior year August were found to have a significant effect on D. frontalis numbers, and model accuracy was {\textbackslash}textasciitilde89\%. Beetle suitability was assessed for 1981–2100 under three different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP). The model indicated that the suitability of D. frontalis has increased from 1981 to 2019 in certain regions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia, while Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee, East Texas, and Virginia had low suitability. Future projections indicated comparable D. frontalis numbers to current numbers under the lowest SSP of 2.1 ◦C by year 2100, but D. frontalis may decrease under higher warming projections. The same climatic predictors influenced T. dubius, except average September maximum temperature replaced August maximum temperatures in the model. Understanding how these abiotic factors influence forest pest populations may better guide prevention and management practices aimed at identifying high risk areas and reducing pest outbreaks.},

A crucial measure in pest control is the removal of infested trees before the beetles leave the bark, which generally happens before the end of June. However, stressed tree crowns do not show any significant color changes in the visible spectrum at this early-stage of infestation, making early detection difficult. In order to detect the related forest stress at an early stage, we investigated the differences in radar and spectral signals of healthy and stressed trees. How the characteristics of stressed trees changed over time was analyzed for the whole vegetation season, which covered the period before attacks (April), early-stage infestation (‘green-attacks’, May to July), and middle to late-stage infestation (August to October). The results show that spectral differences already existed at the beginning of the vegetation season, before the attacks. The spectral separability between the healthy and infested samples did not change significantly during the ‘green-attack’ stage. The results indicate that the trees were stressed before the attacks and had spectral signatures that differed from healthy ones. These stress-induced spectral changes could be more efficient indicators of early infestations than the ‘green-attack’ symptoms.},

	abstract = {Bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis (Wangenh.) K. Koch) is an important component of many hardwood forest systems in the northern hardwood forests of the Lake States. Extensive mortality of the species was observed in a long-term field experimental site in a second growth northern hardwood forest of Wisconsin between 2010 and 2016. We quantified and documented the characteristics of the mortality, investigated the relationship between bitternut hickory density and mortality patterns, and assessed the persistence of hickory regeneration. The presence of a pathogenic fungus (Ceratocystis smalleyi Johnson and Harrington) and hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus Say) were identified as the main cause of mortality in other instances of hickory decline during a similar time period in the Midwest and Northeast. We investigated the role of these agents through post hoc analysis. Tree surveys of mapped stems ≥10 cm dbh conducted periodically from 2005 to 2016 indicated mortality of hickory rose sharply to 35\% year− 1 from 2010 to 2016. This is a substantial increase in mortality relative to the dominant species at the site (Acer saccharum Marshall, Tilia americana L., and Fraxinus spp.) which was 1.11\% year− 1 in the same time period. Mortality rates were higher in larger stems (≥20 cm dbh) than smaller stems (10 {\textbackslash}textless 20 cm dbh). Additional analyses evaluated whether mortality rates were affected by localized species composition, using the proportion of hickory stems among neighboring trees. Proportion of hickory stems, diameter, and crown class proved to be statistically important in predicting mortality in individual hickory stems. The density of hickory regeneration in the {\textbackslash}textless30 cm tall height class decreased from 2010 to 2016. Overall the bitternut hickory population significantly declined, especially the larger sized trees, and this decline will have lasting consequences on the persistence of the species in the area. Potential management actions for mitigating impacts of such rapid hickory decline events, mainly selective thinning, are discussed. Methods for maintaining this co-occurring species is increasingly important as several other codominant species in northern hardwood forests are also decreasing.},

	abstract = {Abstract The recent Californian hot drought (2012–2016) precipitated unprecedented ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) mortality, largely attributable to the western pine beetle ( Dendroctonus brevicomis ; WPB). Broad-scale climate conditions can directly shape tree mortality patterns, but mortality rates respond non-linearly to climate when local-scale forest characteristics influence the behavior of tree-killing bark beetles (e.g., WPB). To test for these cross-scale interactions, we conduct aerial drone surveys at 32 sites along a gradient of climatic water deficit (CWD) spanning 350 km of latitude and 1000 m of elevation in WPB-impacted Sierra Nevada forests. We map, measure, and classify over 450,000 trees within 9 km 2 , validating measurements with coincident field plots. We find greater size, proportion, and density of ponderosa pine (the WPB host) increase host mortality rates, as does greater CWD. Critically, we find a CWD/host size interaction such that larger trees amplify host mortality rates in hot/dry sites. Management strategies for climate change adaptation should consider how bark beetle disturbances can depend on cross-scale interactions, which challenge our ability to predict and understand patterns of tree mortality.},

	abstract = {Research Highlights: Bark beetles are important agents of disturbance regimes in temperate forests, and specifically in a connected wind-bark beetle disturbance system. Large-scale windthrows trigger population growth of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) from endemic to epidemic levels, thereby allowing the killing of Norway spruce trees over several consecutive years. Background and Objectives: There is a lack of evidence to differentiate how outbreaks are promoted by the effects of environmental variables versus beetle preferences of trees from endemic to outbreak. However, little is known about how individual downed-tree characteristics and local conditions such as tree orientation and solar radiation affect beetle colonization of downed trees. Materials and Methods: To answer this question, we investigated the infestation rates and determined tree death categories (uprooted, broken, and stump) in wind-damaged areas in Western Tatra Mts. in Carpathians (Slovakia) from 2014–2016, following a windthrow in May 2014. In total, we investigated 225 trees over eight transects. For every tree, we measured its morphological (tree height, crown characteristics), environmental (solar radiation, terrain conditions, trunk zenith), temporal (time since wind damage), and beetle infestation (presence, location of attack, bark desiccation) parameters. We applied Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) to unravel the main drivers of I. typographus infestations. Results: Over the first year, beetles preferred to attack broken trees and sun-exposed trunk sides over uprooted trees; the infestation on shaded sides started in the second year along with the infestation of uprooted trees with lower desiccation rates. We found that time since wind damage, stem length, and incident solar radiation increased the probability of beetle infestation, although both solar radiation and trunk zenith exhibited nonlinear variability. Our novel variable trunk zenith appeared to be an important predictor of bark beetle infestation probability. We conclude that trunk zenith as a simple measure defining the position of downed trees over the terrain can anticipate beetle infestation. Conclusions: Our findings contribute to understanding of the bark beetle’s preferences to colonize windthrown trees in the initial years after the primary wind damage. Further, our findings can help to identify trees that are most susceptible to beetle infestation and to prioritize management actions to control beetle population while maintaining biodiversity.},

Knowledge on the spatial distribution of infected-spruce areas is vital for effective and sustainable forest management. Medium-spatial-resolution (20–30 m) satellite images are well-suited for spruce forest disturbance monitoring at a landscape and regional scale following bark beetle outbreaks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the health of a Norway spruce stand after a bark beetle outbreak based on Landsat 8 images and thematic and vector data, supplemented with selected climate variables. This research was conducted for a spruce stand in the Białowiez˙ a Forest District in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019. We hypothesised that the changes in spruce health would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the NDVI distributions during the studied years. Our research revealed that the weather conditions in the period of May–September were beneﬁcial for beetle development and detrimental for the spruce stand, particularly in 2015, 2018, and 2019. SWIR-NIR-G and NDVI images showed a gradual deterioration in spruce health. The quantitative NDVI distributions varied; the minimum, mean, and median decreased; and the distribution shape of the index values changed over the studied years. An analysis of the spatial NDVI distributions revealed that the threshold NDVI value separating spruce stand areas in good and poor health was ca. 0.6. This study conﬁrmed the applicability of NDVI for monitoring alterations in spruce stands, and indicated that spatial NDVI distributions can provide valuable support in forest monitoring at a landscape scale, since mediumresolution, ready-to-use NDVI images are easily available from the Landsat archives, facilitating the routine assessment of stand health.},

Comparison of closely related tree species that vary in their susceptibility to bark beetles could provide insights into such mechanisms. Here, we compare physical and chemical characteristics of blue (Picea pungens Engelm.) and Engelmann (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) spruce, species rarely (blue) and frequently (Engelmann) selected and colonized by the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) in the western U.S. At three sites (Utah, U.S.) where these species co-occur, 15 trees of each species were selected and traits important for bark beetle survival and population dynamics were measured and compared (bark and phloem thickness, resin flow, phloem and volatile chemistry, beetle landing and colonization success). There were significant differences in bark and phloem thickness and resin flow between species. Bark was thicker and phloem was thinner in blue spruce than Engelmann spruce whereas resin flow was highly variable but greater in blue spruce. Concentrations of within-phloem terpenes in blue spruce were more than double those for Engelmann spruce. Engelmann spruce foliage emitted greater concentrations of volatiles than blue spruce. Spruce beetles landed at higher rates on baited Engelmann spruce than baited blue spruce, and Engelmann spruce was more likely to be colonized. Collectively, these results suggest that blue spruce is a less suitable host for spruce beetle than Engelmann spruce due to a combination of factors including: thicker bark, thinner phloem, higher resin flow, lower concentrations of volatile terpenes, and higher concentrations of constitutive terpenes in phloem tissue, several which are known to be toxic to spruce beetles.},

Forest stands already poorly adapted to current environmental conditions, such as secondary Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

By means of a simulation study, a secondary Norway spruce forest management unit in Austria was studied under conditions of climatic change with regard to effects of bark beetle disturbance on timber production and carbon sequestration over a time period of 100 years. The modiﬁed patch model PICUS v1.41, including a submodule of bark beetle-induced tree mortality, was employed to assess four alternative management strategies: (a) Norway spruce age-class forestry, (b) Norway spruce continuous cover forestry, (c) conversion to mixed species stands, and (d) no management. Two sets of simulations were investigated, one without the consideration of biotic disturbances, the other including possible bark beetle damages. Simulations were conducted for a de-trended baseline climate (1961–1990) as well as for two transient climate change scenarios featuring a distinct increase in temperature. The main objectives were to: (i) estimate the effects of bark beetle damage on timber production and carbon (C) sequestration under climate change; (ii) assess the effects of disregarding bark beetle disturbance in the analysis.},

We analyzed a 16year time-series from the European Alps of timber loss in Picea abies Karsten forests due to I. typographus attacks and used a discrete population model and an information theoretic approach to compare multiple competing hypotheses. The occurrence of dry summers combined with warm temperatures appeared as the main abiotic triggers of severity of outbreaks. We also found an endogenous negative feedback with a 2-year lag suggesting a potential important role of natural enemies. Forest damage per hectare averaged 7-fold higher where spruce was planted in sites warmer than those within its historical climatic range. Dry summers, but not temperature, was related to upward shifts in the altitudinal outbreak range.

A network of more than 300 climate stations, comprising time series of air temperatures both observed as well as simulated using regional climate models, is exploited on the country scale. It is shown that current conditions strongly favor univoltine behavior, whereas climate scenarios predict almost strictly bivoltine behavior for southern Norway in 2071-2100. The dynamics of this threshold phenomenon is investigated in detail. Using a logistic regression, the impact of regional warming can be described as a northward movement of bivoltinism by some 600 kilometres.

	abstract = {Under present climate conditions, Ips typographus (L.) is Europe's most critical disturbance agent for mature Norway spruce (Picea abies). With ongoing climate change, the bark beetle will most probably become more prominent as a pest. The aim of this study was to analyse the dispersal performance of I. typographus under various weather conditions, especially hot days with a maximum air temperature above 30°C. In a field study, marked bark beetles were released from breeding logs and could be retraced in traps distributed across the survey area. With daily collections of the trapped beetles, it was possible to analyse the flight activity and the average flight distance of the bark beetles during hot, moderate and cool days. The numbers of daily catches and the average flight distance during the hottest days (air temperature maximum ≥30°C) did not significantly differ from the moderate days (air temperature maximum ≥22°C and {\textbackslash}textless30°C). The numbers of daily catches and the average flight distance during the cool days (air temperature maximum {\textbackslash}textless22°C) were significantly lower than during hot and moderate days. The results give an insight on the dispersal capacity of I. typographus under climate change driven future conditions. Increased air temperatures do not seem to impair the flight performance of I. typographus. A small proportion of cool days during the swarming period even seems to favour dispersal of I. typographus.},

A central attractive-trap pole was surrounded by three passive-trap poles spaced 50 or 100 m away at the apices of an equilateral triangle. The catches of Tomicuspiniperda and other scolytid species on the attractive-trap pole baited with host monoterpenes, or the catches of Ips typographus attracted to synthetic pheromone, were compared to passive trap catches in a Scots pine forest or in a Norway spruce clear-cut, respectively. Information about flight height distributions of the above scolytid species, and Hylurgops palliatus, Cryphalus abietis, Pityogenes chalcographus, P. quadridens, P. bidentatus, and Trypodendron domesticum were obtained on the passive and attractive trap poles. A new method is presented for determining the densities of flying insects based on the passive trap's dimensions and catch, duration of test, and speed of insect. Also, a novel concept, the effective attraction radius (EAR), is presented for comparing attractants of species, which is independent of insect density, locality, or duration of test. The EAR is obtained by the ratio of attractive and passive trap catches and the dimensions of the passive trap, and thus should correlate positively with the strength of the attractant and the distance of attraction. EARs are determined from catch data of T. piniperda and L typographus as well as from the data of previous investigations on the same or other bark beetles.},

The model is based on a digital elevation model used for interpolation of temperature and solar radiation to calculate the microclimatic conditions (bark temperature) for the beetles’ development. Additionally, the beetles’ phenology at Kalkalpen National Park was monitored along with air and bark temperature measurements. The onset of host tree infestation in spring was estimated using a lower threshold of 16.5 8C for ﬂight activity and a mean thermal sum of 140 degree-days (dd) from beginning of April 1st onward. Rate of brood development was calculated from accumulated degree-days of hourly temperature data using upper and lower temperature thresholds of 38.9 and 8.3 8C, respectively, and a nonlinear function for calculating effective thermal sums. Re-emergence of parental beetles occurred at a time when 49.7\% of the thermal sum for total development (557 dd) was reached. The model includes the discontinuance of the beetle’s reproductive activity at a day length {\textbackslash}textless14.5 h. The rate of successful hibernation of established broods is predicted by assessing the developmental stage of initiated generations at the beginning of the cold period. For validation we compared the timing of phenological events in the ﬁeld with predicted events using both, hourly recorded data at trap trees in the terrain and generated daily topoclimatic data. Using topoclimatic data, the onset of infestation was predicted with a mean absolute error of 1.3 days. The observed onset of emergence of ﬁlial beetles in the ﬁeld was estimated with a mean error of 39 dd. Our PHENIPS explicitly considers the strong effects of regional topography and stand conditions on local air and bark temperature and can be used for precise monitoring of the actual state of bark beetle development at the speciﬁc stand/tree level. Using topoclimatic data, PHENIPS simulates the maximum number of generations which is necessary to assess the potential impact of bark beetle outbreaks at regional scale. Further applications of PHENIPS for site-speciﬁc hazard rating of bark beetle infestation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Modern forestry is increasingly confronted with challenges that appear with intensive forest management and the progression of the effects of climate change. The forestry sector is able to react to the changing conditions by adapting management plans, forest structure or planting tree species with a higher stress resistance. However, during stand management activities, silvicultural treatments and harvesting operations can have an impact on the further development of the remaining forest ecosystem. In Germany, the most widely used harvesting system for thinning operations is a single-grip harvester used for felling and processing trees followed by a forwarder for timber extraction from the machine operating trails to roadside. In this research project, debarking rollers and other modifications designed for Eucalyptus harvesting heads were tested on conventional harvesting heads for the first time to assess the possibility of adding debarking to mechanized forest operations under Central European conditions. Seven field tests with varying tree species, diameters and age classes, were established within German state forests in Lower Saxony and in Bavaria. These tests were repeated in both summer and winter seasons to evaluate the influence of associated tree sap flows on debarking quality. Three different harvesting heads were modified to assess the altered mechanical characteristics and setups. To assess debarking ability originating from head modifications, a photo-optical measurement system developed within the scope of the project was used. The results demonstrate that especially for summertime operations, simple modifications to currently used harvesting heads are able to provide an average debarking efficiency up to 90\% depending on the modifications. Another key finding is that a negatively affected sap flow, experienced during wintertime operations, resulted in 46\% lower debarking efficiency, while spruce bark beetle infestations only resulted in a wider spread of the variation. Additionally, the vertical position of the log within the tree proved to have an influence on debarking efficiency, resulting in 15\% lower average debarking for butt logs and 9\% for top logs as compared to middle logs. Since a debarking process requires the stem to be fed through the harvesting head on multiple occasions to remove bark, average harvesting productivity might be reduced by approx. 10\% compared to productivity measured with conventional harvesting heads. Considering the results and the extent of the modifications, the system proved to be a potential addition to existing harvesting methods facing changing challenges in future forestry.},

Population densities were estimated by periodic samplings in the pre-emerging insect populations developing under the bark of attacked trees. Data were collected between July 2000 and October 2001. I. typographus population density (per m2) increased respectively by 28\%, 105\%, and 212\% in one year in the three sites surveyed. Six hymenopteran ectoparasitoids were found: Coeloides bostrichorum Giraud and Dendrosoter middendorfﬁ Ratzeburg (Hymenoptera: Braconidae); Rhopalicus tutela (Walker), Roptrocerus xylophagorum (Ratzeburg), Roptrocerus mirus (Walker) and Dinotiscus eupterus (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). After two years, the parasitoid populations increased in terms of average density but parasitism rates remained at a relatively low level, ranging from 0\% to 40\%, with 60\% of the trees having a parasitism rate below 5\%.

In a first series of 6 standing, attacked trees, a large number of 1 dm2samples (56171 samples, according to tree) were collected and analysed. Sets of samples were selected at random with successiveincrements of one unit among the samples from each tree, and the mean numbers of beetles and standard deviations in each of these random sets were used to calculate changes in sampling precision as the number of samples in a set increased. For each tree, there was an excellent fit with a power function linking sampling error and number of samples in each set. Fifty random samples per tree allowed estimates of the mean with an error of \%24\%. Further analysis of sample variation along and around the trunks showed that beetle density did not vary around but along the trunks, suggesting that sampling should not be totally random but should take into account longitudinal changes in beetle populations on attacked trees. At each level of each tree, sets of samples were selected at random with successive increments of one unit to calculate changes in sampling precision. At any level along the trunks, taking four 1 dm2samples yielded estimates with an error inferior to 10\%. To validate the conclusions drawn from these results, eight other trees were then sampled at regular intervals along the trunk. A total of 43-56 samples were taken per tree, yielding estimates with a computed error of \%13\% of the mean. Beetle density along the trunks was found to increase linearly along the basal portions of the infested stems (l5’?’0 of the infested stem), remain constant along the following 65\% of the infested stems, and decrease linearly along the terminal 20\%. Taking all this information into account, the total pre-emergent beetle population in each tree was estimated. Total beetle production per tree ranged from 35 000-72 000.},

All attacked standing trees, areas with windthrown trees, catches in pheromone traps, timing of salvage harvests, and stands exposed to attack were registered and mapped in 1982 and 1983. Three different indices for attack density in areas around windthrown trees, infested trees and pheromone traps were calculated using GIS (ArcView). The attack densities in 1983 around areas with windthrown trees salvaged after 1 July 1982 were signi®cantly higher than for areas salvaged earlier. Attack densities around windthrown trees salvaged between 15 May and 1 July, just after the main spring¯ight period, were the lowest. The maximum distance from an old attack to a new was 650 m and there was an old attack within 500 m of all new attacks. Attack densities around pheromone traps were not correlated with the number of beetles caught in the traps. The majority of the beetles emerging from an epidemic attack dispersed over short distances (i.e. {\textbackslash}textless500 m) before entering a new host. This local dispersal may best be countered by removing old breeding sites/windthrown trees in the period between spring-¯ight and the emergence of the new generation, i.e. by using the windthrown trees as bait trees.

	abstract = {Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is economically the most important European tree species but is particularly prone to insect infestation calamities. Among the biotic risks threatening Norway spruce in Europe the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) is the most signiﬁcant pest. On the basis of projected climate-change scenarios higher temperatures and longer growing seasons will probably lead to even more frequent and serious outbreaks of this pest as a result of more generations per year. At the same time periods of drought may become more frequent and be of longer duration resulting in a physiological weakening of Norway spruce. Hence, it is necessary to develop concepts that can be used in long term silvicultural planning to minimize the risk of bark beetle infestations until trees reach maturity. For an adaptation of forest management it is necessary to identify and quantify risks at the level of silvicultural planning units. Therefore, we developed, a mixed binary linear regression model, which describes the effects of different stand and site variables on the infestation risk that bark beetles exert on spruce stands in the Harz Mountains. The relevant data are based on a decade of detailed forest booking records carried out by the Lower Saxony State Forest in the western Harz Mountains and cover 12,085 individual registrations on 4352 stands. In the model, the stand parameters age and proportion of spruce, and site parameters available water capacity, thermal sum and the Topex-to-Distance Index have signiﬁcant effects on the infestation risk. It is presumed that the impact of various but unknown silvicultural measures and pest control tactics in managed forests can be quantiﬁed by random effects on the forest sub-district level.},

	abstract = {Adoption of the retention silviculture system in much of coastal British Columbia, Canada, has brought concern over the windﬁrmness of retained trees. Knowledge concerning windthrow risk factors is inadequate for risk prediction in partially harvested stands and in structurally complex forests. In this study, we present a methodology to predict the occurrence of windthrow after partial-cut harvesting in areas with complex stand and terrain conditions. Anticipating that post-harvest wind exposure (fetch) would be a key attribute, we developed and tested several GIS-based methods of characterizing fetch after partial harvest. The methods were applied in a case study in Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Measurements of 1215 trees were obtained from 234 sample plots in retention system cutblocks, which were harvested from 1 to 6 years previously. Sixteen percent of the sampled trees were windthrown. Logistic regression models were ﬁt using tree, neighbourhood, and stand-level variables to predict the probability of individual trees being windthrown. The best-ﬁt models correctly predicted the status of 72 and 74\% of the sampled trees. The proportion of damaged trees increased with increasing tree height–diameter ratio and crown density, and with increasing fetch. The proportion of damaged trees decreased with increasing tree percent live crown and post-harvest stand density. We recommend that forest managers plan to retain at least 20\% of original stand density in locations where windthrow is a concern, and preferentially retain trees with low height–diameter ratios, sparse crowns, and deep live crowns.},

	abstract = {Changing forest disturbance regimes pose a major challenge for current day forestry. Yet our understanding of the economic impacts of disturbances remains incomplete. Existing valuations of losses from natural disturbances commonly exclude extreme events and neglect impacts on standing timber. Here we develop a new methodology to assess the economic impact of natural disturbances addressing these limitations. We couple an empirical function of forest growth with survival modelling for the example of Norway spruce (Picea abies), using MonteCarlo simulations to quantify the economic losses from natural disturbances. We illustrate the effect of extreme disturbance events by analyzing the lowest (worst) 5\% of simulated economic returns. Ranging between € − 2,611 and − 34,416 per hectare, disturbance-induced economic losses varied greatly, depending on the valu­ ation approach applied. Accounting for extreme events and disturbance impacts on standing timber resulted in 262–1218\% higher losses compared to damages derived with common valuation approaches that neglect these aspects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that refraining from salvage logging after extreme disturbances does not necessarily result in major economic losses for forest owners, indicating a potential cost-effective avenue to improve forest biodiversity. Our approach presents an important step towards quantifying the economic impacts of changing forest disturbance regimes.},

A selection cutting system has been performed in the uneven-aged forest stand for 81 years and the even-aged stand was established after clear-cutting 81 years ago. Timber productivity has been measured in the uneven stand for 81 years and in the even-aged stand for 52 years. C storage was determined based on tree measurements, tree biomass functions, soil samples and C analyses from trees and soil. Litter fall was sampled during one year and CO2 efflux from the soil was measured during one growing season. The present tree C storage (including roots) was 210 Mg C ha–1 in the even-aged stand and 76 Mg C ha–1 in the uneven-aged stand, while the corresponding figures for C in the soil was 178 and 199 Mg C ha–1. The long term timber production in the uneven-aged stand was measured to be 95\% of the even-aged stand and the difference in net C sequestration was 37 Mg ha–1 in an 81 year period in favour the even-aged stand. The highest present CO2 efflux from soil was measured in the even-aged stand. The total net C sequestered in trees during 81 years minus the present soil C-stock accounts to 16 Mg ha-1 in favour the even-aged system.},

	abstract = {China has recently announced a reform of forestry policy, with a major goal being to transform from plantation to heterogeneous forests, which have higher resistance to pests and disease and house more biodiversity. One driver of reform is increased intensity and frequency of pest-induced tree-dieback events. To inform management, we ask what effects these events have on insect biodiversity in Pinus yunnanensis monocultures in Yunnan province, the province with one of the highest proportions of forest cover in China. We sampled aerial arthropods (mostly insect) biodiversity along gradients of Pinus yunnanensis dieback severity using Malaise traps and used meta­ barcoding to characterise the insect community. We used MS-GDM (‘multi-site generalized dissimilarity modelling of zeta diversity’), zeta-decline analysis, and iNEXT (‘Interpolation and extrapolation for species di­ versity’) to assess community change as functions of forest-structure covariates. Metabarcoding of Malaisetrapped insects reveals that bark-beetle induced forest dieback does not result in detectable differences in spe­ cies diversity but does result in compositional change, with the biggest turnover occurring between 0\% and infested-0\%-open-canopy forests and 20\%-infested-20\%-open-canopy forests. Zeta-decline analysis found that the insect community in low-infestation forests is characterized by a stochastic assembly, while in highinfestation forests, the community structure is consistent with niche assembly. Our results thus suggest that bark-beetle dieback mimics natural forest-gap dynamics, consistent with the interpretation of bark beetles as a keystone species in European conifer forests, where it has been proposed that forest heterogeneity can be created efficiently by allowing natural disturbances, including bark-beetle outbreaks, to proceed naturally, without being mitigated by deadwood removal and dense replanting. In Yunnan’s situation, and given predicted increases in bark-beetle dieback severity and frequency, this strategy should probably be supplemented with anthropogenic treatments, such as deadwood enhancement and planting of multiple tree species, to accelerate the succession of plantations into heterogeneous forests.},

	abstract = {Resilience and functionality of European Norway spruce forests are increasingly threatened by mass outbreaks of the bark beetle Ips typographus promoted by heat, wind throw and drought. Here, we review current knowledge on Norway spruce and I. typographus interactions from the perspective of drought-stressed trees, host selection, colonisation behaviour of beetles, with multi-level effects of symbiotic ophiostomatoid fungi. By including chemo-ecological, molecular and behavioural perspectives, we provide a comprehensive picture on this complex, multitrophic system in the light of climate change. Trees invest carbon into specialised metabolism to produce defence compounds against biotic invaders; processes that are strongly affected by physiological stress such as drought. Spruce bark contains numerous terpenoid and phenolic substances, which are important for bark beetle aggregation and attack success. Abiotic stressors such as increased temperatures and drought affect composition, amounts and emission rates of volatile compounds. Thus, drought events may influence olfactory responses of I. typographus, and further the pheromone communication enabling mass attack. In addition, I. typographus is associated with numerous ophiostomatoid fungal symbionts with multiple effects on beetle life history. Symbiotic fungi degrade spruce toxins, help to exhaust tree defences, produce beetle semiochemicals, and possibly provide nutrition. As the various fungal associates have different temperature optima, they can influence the performance of I. typographus differently under changing environmental conditions. Finally, we discuss why effects of drought on tree-killing by bark beetles are still poorly understood and provide an outlook on future research on this eruptive species using both, field and laboratory experiments.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the study was to develop, calibrate and validate a comprehensive phenological model for the spatiotemporal simulation of the seasonal development of the six-toothed spruce bark beetle, Pityogenes chalcographus (CHAPY). The validation dataset was acquired through monitoring of the bark beetle's phenology at eight sites in Slovenia in 2017 and 2018, along with air and bark temperature measurements. The predictions were made using air temperature from the INCA system (Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis), which is used to calculate the effective bark temperature for beetle development. Since the biology of P. chalcographus is poorly studied, a sensitivity analysis was used to pinpoint the most important model parameters. The first order (main) effect was the highest for the lower developmental threshold (DTL), while the second order (interaction, total) effect was the highest for the optimum temperature (TO). DTL was calibrated with an iterative procedure, and the best result with the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) was achieved at 7.4°C. Effective temperatures in the range between TO and the upper developmental threshold were calculated with a nonlinear function whose parameters were appropriately calibrated. The spring date threshold when the model calculation starts was calibrated with an iterative procedure and set at 9th March, which had the minimum MAE. The onset of Norway spruce infestation in spring was estimated using a lower threshold of 15.6°C for flight activity and a mean thermal sum of 216.5 degree-days (dd) from 9th March onward. The observed mean thermal sum required for total development of filial beetles was 652.8 ± 22.7°C, while the predicted mean thermal sum was 635.4 ± 31.4°C. Re-emergence of parental beetles occurred when 52.7\% of the minimum thermal sum for total development was reached. The relative duration of the egg, larval and combination of the pupal and teneral adult developmental stages was 9.4\%, 58.2\% and 32.4\%, respectively. Mass swarming concluded in the end of August when daylength was lower than 13.6 h, which was determined with the independent dataset of 1,017 pheromone traps. The diapause initiation at a daylength {\textbackslash}textless 13.6 h is included in the model as an assumption. Successful hibernation of established broods is predicted by assessing the developmental stage of initiated generations at the 31st December. For validation, we compared the timing of phenological events in the field with predicted events using both 30-minute recorded data at study sites in the field and hourly data from the INCA. The time of spring swarming was estimated with a MAE of 5.6 days. The onset of infestation was predicted with a MAE of 6.0 days. The predicted onset of emergence of filial beetles was estimated with a MAE of 2.1 days. Additionally, CHAPY simulates the number of generations. CHAPY was successfully incorporated into two publicly available web applications. Development of the model revealed several knowledge gaps in P. chalcographus phenology, thus providing opportunities for further research of the second most damaging bark beetle of Norway spruce in Central Europe and for further improvement of the CHAPY model. Potential applications of the model for monitoring and management of P. chalcographus are discussed.},

Karst. and Pityogenes chalcographus constitute a commonly observed host tree–insect association in Eurasia, with the natural distribution of the bark beetle overlapping that of Norway spruce. The southernmost borderline of their distributions occurs in the Elatia forest (Mt. Rodopi, Greece), where these interacting organisms may experience severe conditions due to the effects of climate change. In order to assess the dynamics of this host tree–insect association, the genetic diversity of both organisms was studied. In contrast to previous studies, the assessment of molecular diversity was based on the same mitochondrial gene (Cytochrome Oxidase One) sequence for both host and pest. This analysis revealed a remarkably higher genetic diversity of P. chalcographus compared to that of P. abies, something that renders the insect capable not only of adapting to novel environmental conditions, but even of shifting to other host species. On the contrary, P. abies presented a narrow genetic base, a potential drawback at the southern-most region of the species natural distribution. Synthesizing the preliminary outcome for both organisms, it appears that P. chalcographus exhibits an evolutionary advantage over P. abies, something that should be considered when planning conservation strategies for the relict forest of Elatia.},

	abstract = {Cambiophagous insects, ﬁres and windthrow cause signiﬁcant forest disturbances, generating ecological changes and economical losses. The bark beetle (Ips typographus L.), inhabiting coniferous forests and eliminating weakened trees, plays a key role in posing a threat to tree stands, which are dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) and covers a large part of mountain areas, as well as the lowlands of Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. Due to the dynamics of the phenomena taking place, the EU recommends constant monitoring of forests in terms of large-area disturbances and factors affecting tree stands’ susceptibility to destruction. The right tools for this are multispectral satellite images, which regularly and free of charge provide up-to-date information on changes in the environment. The aim of this study was to develop a method of identifying disturbances of spruce stands, including the identiﬁcation of bark beetle outbreaks. Sentinel 2 images from 2015–2018 were used for this purpose; the reference data were high-resolution aerial images, satellite WorldView 2, as well as ﬁeld veriﬁcation data. Support Vector Machines (SVM) distinguished six classes: deciduous forests, coniferous forests, grasslands, rocks, snags (dieback of standing trees) and cuts/windthrow. Remote sensing vegetation indices, Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD), Multivariate Alteration Detection/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAD/MAF), iteratively re-weighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (iMAD) and trained SVM signatures from another year, stacked band rasters allowed us to identify: (1) no changes; (2) dieback of standing trees; (3) logging or falling down of trees. The overall accuracy of the SVM classiﬁcation oscillated between 97–99\%; it was observed that in 2015–2018, as a result of the windthrow and bark beetle outbreaks and the consequences of those natural disturbances (e.g., sanitary cuts), approximately 62.5 km2 of coniferous stands (29\%) died in the studied area of the Tatra Mountains.},

The current spruce bark beetle infestation in the Polish part of the Białowiez˙a Forest (BF), which started in 2012, is considered the largest in history and has nearly eliminated Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) as a major forest tree species there. This research analyzed the dynamics and spatial extent of the BF outbreak from 2015 to 2019. The extensive beetle epidemic caused a more than six times higher number of infested trees in 2019 as compared to 2015. Under the conditions of the unprecedented ongoing I. typographus outbreak, the dynamics of spruce stand mortality varied across the study area. A lower spruce mortality was observed in Białowiez˙a National Park as compared to other forest districts. Host and environmental factors influenced the timing of spruce mortality. Spruce height, stand age, the proportion of spruce, the share of area covered by tree crowns, excluding spruce and dominant species in the stands, were the key factors of bark beetle infestation. The most intensive outbreak progressed in stands older than 100 years dominated by spruce, and areas with the lowest dynamics of spruce dieback were localized in mixed young forests or pine stands. The methods and results presented in this study serve as baseline information, supporting the efforts to model the spread of bark beetles and future decision-making.},

Karst.) trees was investigated by means of sap flow measurements made with the heat field deformation method. Irrigation was applied to a limited portion of the root system to steepen gradients of water potential in the soil and thus enhance rates of HR. On completion of the sap flow measurements, and to aid in their interpretation, the structure of the root system of seven of the investigated trees was exposed to a depth of 30 cm with a supersonic air-stream (airspade). Before irrigation, vertical redistribution of water was observed in large coarse roots and some adjacent small lateral roots. Immediately after localized irrigation, horizontal redistribution of water from watered roots to dry roots via the stem base was demonstrated. The amount of horizontal distribution depended on the position of the receiving roots relative to the watered roots and the absorbing area of the watered root. No redistribution from watered roots via dry soil to roots of neighboring trees was detected. Responses of sap flow to localized irrigation were more pronounced in small lateral roots than in large branching roots where release and uptake of water are integrated. Sap flow measurements with multi-point sensors along radii in large lateral roots demonstrated water extraction from different soil horizons. We conclude that synchronous measurements of sap flow in both small and large lateral roots are needed to study water absorption and transport in tree root systems.},

	abstract = {With climate change, extreme storms are expected to occur more frequently. These storms can cause severe forest damage, provoking direct and indirect economic losses for forestry. To minimize economic losses, the windthrow areas need to be detected fast to prevent subsequent biotic damage, for example, related to beetle infestations. Remote sensing is an efﬁcient tool with high potential to cost-efﬁciently map large storm affected regions. Storm Niklas hit South Germany in March 2015 and caused widespread forest cover loss. We present a two-step change detection approach applying commercial very high-resolution optical Earth Observation data to spot forest damage. First, an object-based bi-temporal change analysis is carried out to identify windthrow areas larger than 0.5 ha. For this purpose, a supervised Random Forest classiﬁer is used, including a semi-automatic feature selection procedure; for image segmentation, the large-scale mean shift algorithm was chosen. Input features include spectral characteristics, texture, vegetation indices, layer combinations and spectral transformations. A hybrid-change detection approach at pixel-level subsequently identiﬁes small groups of fallen trees, combining the most important features of the previous processing step with Spectral Angle Mapper and Multivariate Alteration Detection. The methodology was evaluated on two test sites in Bavaria with RapidEye data at 5 m pixel resolution. The results regarding windthrow areas larger than 0.5 ha were validated with reference data from ﬁeld visits and acquired through orthophoto interpretation. For the two test sites, the novel object-based change detection approach identiﬁed over 90\% of the windthrow areas (≥0.5 ha). The red edge channel was the most important for windthrow identiﬁcation. Accuracy levels of the change detection at tree level could not be calculated, as it was not possible to collect ﬁeld data for single trees, nor was it possible to perform an orthophoto validation. Nevertheless, the plausibility and applicability of the pixel-based approach is demonstrated on a second test site.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of precipitation rates in high-mountain regions is not sufﬁciently captured by stateof-the-art climate reanalysis products due to their limited spatial resolution. Thus there exists a large gap between the available data sets and the demands of climate impact studies. The presented approach aims to generate spatially high resolution precipitation ﬁelds for a target area in central Asia, covering the Tibetan Plateau and the adjacent mountain ranges and lowlands. Based on the assumption that observed local-scale precipitation amounts are triggered by varying large-scale atmospheric situations and modiﬁed by local-scale topographic characteristics, the statistical downscaling approach estimates local-scale precipitation rates as a function of large-scale atmospheric conditions, derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis and high-resolution terrain parameters. Since the relationships of the predictor variables with local-scale observations are rather unknown and highly nonlinear, an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) was utilized for the development of adequate transfer functions. Different ANN architectures were evaluated with regard to their predictive performance.},

	abstract = {Storms are the main abiotic disturbance in European forests, eﬀects of which are expected to intensify in the future, hence the importance of forest stand stability is increasing. The predisposition of Norway spruce to wind damage appears to be enhanced by pathogens such as Heterobasidion spp., which reduce stability of individual trees. However, detailed information about the eﬀects of the root rot on the stability of individual trees across diverse soil types is still lacking. The aim of the study was to assess the eﬀect of root rot on the individual tree stability of Norway spruce growing on drained peat and mineral soils. In total, 77 Norway spruce trees (age 50–80 years) growing in four stands were tested under static loading. The presence of Heterobasidion spp. had a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect on the bending moment at primary and secondary failure of the tested trees irrespectively of soil type. This suggests increased legacy eﬀects (e.g., susceptibility to pathogens and pests due to fractured roots and altered water uptake) of storms. Damaged trees act as weak spots increasing the susceptibility of stands to wind damage, thus forming a negative feedback loop and contributing to an ongoing decline in vitality of Norway spruce stands following storms in the study region in the future. Accordingly, the results support the importance of timely identiﬁcation of the decayed trees, lowering stand density and/or shortening rotation period as the measures to counteract the increasing eﬀects of storms on Norway spruce stands.},

	abstract = {Bark stripping caused by cervids can have a long-lasting negative eﬀect on tree vitality. Such trees of low vitality might be more susceptible to other disturbances. The amplifying eﬀects of disturbance interactions can cause signiﬁcantly more damage to forest ecosystems than the individual eﬀects of each disturbance. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of bark stripping (stem damage) on the probability of wind damage and snapping height for Norway spruces (Picea Abies (L.) H. Karst.). In this study, we used the Latvian National Forest Inventory data from the period 2004–2018. In the analysis, we used data based on 32,856 trees. To analyse the data, we implemented a Bayesian binary logistic generalised linear mixed-eﬀects model and the linear mixed-eﬀects model. Our results showed that stem damage signiﬁcantly increased the probability of wind damage and aﬀected the snapping height of Norway spruces. Similarly, root damage, the slenderness ratio, the stand age, the stand density, the soil type, and the dominant tree species had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the probability of wind damage. In both periods, trees with stem damage had signiﬁcantly (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) higher probability (odd ratio 1.68) to be wind damaged than trees without stem damage. The stem damaged Norway spruce trees snapped in the ﬁrst 25\% of the tree height, while trees without stem damage snapped around half (50\%) of the tree height. Our results show that stem damage signiﬁcantly alters the eﬀect of wind damage on Norway spruces, suggesting that such damage must be incorporated into wind-risk assessment models.},

	abstract = {Sanitation felling is considered as the main measure to protect managed forests from damage due to outbreaks of the European Spruce Bark Beetle. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of sanitation felling on stopping the spread of a bark beetle population from an un-managed to a managed forest area. For this, we advance an individual-based dispersion model of Ips typographus by adding the inﬂuence of wind on the beetle dispersion and by importing GIS data to simulate real world forests. To validate the new model version and to ﬁnd reasonable parameter values, we conduct simulation experiments to reproduce infestation patterns that occurred in 2015, 2016, and 2017 within the national park Saxon Switzerland, Germany. With the then calibrated model IPS-SPREADS (Infestation Pattern Simulation Supporting PREdisposition Assessment DetailS), we investigate the impact of different factors such as the distance between beetle source trees and the forest border on the amount of damage within the managed forest stand and test the effectiveness of different levels of sanitation felling and its point of action on reducing the amount of damaged trees. As expected, the results of the model calibration show that the direction of wind plays an important role for the occurring infestation patterns and that bark beetle energy reserve is reduced during mass outbreaks. The results of the second experiment show that the main drivers for the amount of damaged trees are the primary attractiveness and the distance to beetle source trees. Sanitation felling effectiveness is highest when performed near the beetle source trees, with considerably high felling intensities and if there is at least some distance to the managed forest. IPS-SPREADS can be used in future studies as a tool for testing further management measures (e.g., pheromone traps) or to assess the risk for bark beetle infestations of forest areas near to wind-felled or already infested trees.},

Irrigation was included in all treatment plots. Heating cables were used to maintain the soil temperature in heated plots at 5°C above that in unheated plots during the growing season. A Kaplan–Meier approach was used to estimate the longevity of fine roots and Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze the effects of the H, F, and HF treatments on the risk of root mortality. The proportion of annual root length production contributed by winter–spring production amounted to 52\% and 49\% in heated plots and heated-fertilized plots, respectively. The annual root length production in C plots was significantly higher than in other treatments, while the HF treatment gave significantly greater production compared with the F treatment. The risk of mortality (hazard ratio) relative to C plots was higher in H plots (358\%) and F plots (191\%). The interaction between heating and fertilizing was strongly significant. The increase in the risk of root mortality in combined fertilization and heating (103\%) was lower than that in the H or F plots. The results show that nitrogen addition combined with warmer temperatures decreases the risk of root mortality, and fine root production is a function of the length of the growing season. In the future, fertilization combined with the warmer temperatures expected to follow predicted climatic change may increase root production in boreal forests at low fertility sites.},

	abstract = {Windfelled Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees play a crucial role in triggering large-scale outbreaks of the Eu­ ropean spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. Outbreak management therefore strives to remove windfelled trees to reduce the risk of outbreaks, a measure referred to as sanitation logging (SL). Although this practice has been traditionally applied, its efficiency in preventing outbreaks remains poorly understood. We used the landscape simulation model iLand to investigate the effects of different spatial configurations and intensities of SL of windfelled trees on the subsequent disturbance by bark beetles. We studied differences between SL applied evenly across the landscape, focused on the vicinity of roads (scenario of limited logging resources) and concentrated in a contiguous block (scenario of spatially diversified management objectives). We focused on a 16 050 ha forest landscape in Central Europe. The removal of {\textbackslash}textgreater80\% of all windfelled trees is required to sub­ stantially reduce bark beetle disturbances. Focusing SL on the vicinity of roads created a “fire break effect” on bark beetle spread, and was moderately efficient in reducing landscape-scale bark beetle disturbance. Block treatments substantially reduced outbreaks in treated areas. Leaving parts of the landscape untreated (e.g., conservation areas) had no significant amplifying effect on outbreaks in managed areas. Climate change increased bark beetle disturbances and reduced the effect of SL. Our results suggest that past outbreak man­ agement methods will not be sufficient to counteract climate-mediated increases in bark beetle disturbance.},

This was done by using basic physiological relationships of intercepted radiation versus biomass production and knowledge of how a water deﬁcit reduces the potential production, derived from results of ﬁeld experiments on nutrient optimisation. To scale these relationships up to regional and national levels, data of incident radiation and humidity during the growing season for all of Sweden were used. The ﬁgures for potential and attainable production indicate that the temperate to boreal climate allows considerably higher production than the current production, if availability of water and nutrients is non-limiting. In northern Sweden, the attainable production is ca. 300\% higher than the current production and in southern Sweden, the yield can be increased by ca. 100\%. In absolute numbers, as a mean for a whole rotation period, it is possible to achieve an annual stem-wood dry mass production of 7–9 Mg haÀ1 in southern and central and ca. 5–6 Mg in northern Sweden. This increased production would mean that rotation periods can be shorter than they are now by 20–30 years in southern Sweden and by ca. 50–60 years in northern Sweden.},

Using Sentinel-2 images as main input, two models have been developed to test the ability of this data source to map bark beetle damage and severity. All models were based on a change detection approach, and required the generation of previous forest mask and dominant species maps. The ﬁrst damage mapping model was developed for 2019 and 2020, and it was based on bi-temporal regressions in spruce areas to estimate forest vitality and bark beetle damage. A second model was developed for 2020 considering all forest area, but excluding clear-cuts and completely dead areas, in order to map only changes in stands dominated by alive trees. The three products were validated with in situ data. All the maps showed high accuracies (acc {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.80). Accuracy was higher than 0.95 and F1-score was higher than 0.88 for areas with high severity, with omission errors under 0.09 in all cases. This conﬁrmed the ability of all the models to detect bark beetle attack at the last phases. Areas with no damage or low severity showed more complex results. The no damage category yielded greater commission errors and relative bias (CEs = 0.30–0.42, relB = 0.42–0.51). The similar results obtained for 2020 leaving out clear-cuts and dead trees proved that the proposed methods could be used to help forest managers ﬁght bark beetle pests. These biotic damage products based on Sentinel-2 can be set up for any location to derive regular forest vitality maps and inform of early damage.},
